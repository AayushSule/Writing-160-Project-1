                In an age where algorithm-fueled echo chambers and mass media foster a herd mentality in the general public, it is not surprising that many seek to try and preserve their individuality and create an identity beyond the general trends. Often, people express this urge through art and music; an example of this phenomenon is <i>Dreamland</i> by Fox Stevenson, a song from his debut album, <i>Killjoy</i>. The lyrics of this song revolve around the namesake Dreamland, which represents the social norms and constructs that restrict him. Through his use of snow symbolism, interactions with others, and the juxtaposition between desires and reality in his lyrics, Stevenson’s <i>Dreamland</i> demonstrates that despite one’s best efforts and desires to escape cultural conditioning, one can never escape it, causing people who want to break free from it to feel inadequate.

                In the main chorus of the song, one of the most prominent lines states “Is this dreamland all that we know? / Swallowing us up in this avalanche” (Stevenson). The snow from the avalanche in this line represents mass culture in general; another example of this is found later in the song when Stevenson sings “And everybody's laughing at me now / From their faces covered in snow” (Stevenson). In this line, the people’s faces being covered in snow shows how the aforementioned avalanche, representing groupthink culture, reaches everyone, and how nobody can seem to escape it. A relevant use of snow symbolism can be found in <i>Hunters in the Snow</i> by Tobias Wolff. In this short story, the all-encompassing snow symbolizes the moral decay of the main characters. While the snow doesn’t symbolize the same thing in <i>Dreamland</i>, it symbolizes a different type of decay: the decay of individual thought in society. Through his usage of snow, Stevenson also conveys that this decrease in individualism reaches everyone. For someone like Stevenson who wishes to break free from societal constraints and let their individualism thrive, this truth would be very disheartening, as he can never reach what he believes his full potential can be. The fact that he mentions “everyone laughing” at him shows that the lack of an escape has gotten to him, and will inevitably get to anyone else who wishes to cultivate their own identity (Stevenson).

            <p>
                This sentiment is further echoed in the lines where he provides anecdotes of his interactions with society. For example, at one point in the song, he “stumble[s] over to a policeman”, but “He says, ‘Son, you better get back home’” (Stevenson). The choice to use a policeman as the figure he bumps into is significant here, as policemen are associated with bringing about order and making sure rules are being followed. Both of these things run counter to what Stevenson stands for, which is being a rebel who dares challenge social expectations. He is also told to go back home, which once again symbolically goes against Stevenson’s personal ethos, as “home” can symbolize comfort and being sheltered, but Stevenson wants to leave the comfort of taking the conventional path. Through this mini anecdote, Stevenson yet again demonstrates that wherever he turns, forces are trying to keep him from being a non-conformist. Another way his lyrics show his interactions with society is when he asks “If I don't believe in all the old gods or the new / How am I supposed to find my way?”. The gods in this line represent old and new ways of thinking, which he says he doesn’t believe in, but as a result, he can’t seem to find his way and place in today’s world. Once again, he shows how not conforming makes him feel lost (and in a way, inadequate), all due to society following set norms, or in this case, gods.

                Other lyrics that develop this point focus on the conflict between Stevenson’s dreams and societal constraints. A lyric that demonstrates this states “Pale shadows of my heroes help me rule the night / Somewhere out there hear my people screaming ‘do it better’ / I'm just an echo of the things I like”. The first line here shows that Stevenson has things he dreams of and the people he idolizes, which give him comfort. However, the next line shows a contrast of being pulled back to reality, where he feels pressure to conform, giving up his dreams as a result. The final line shows how the conflict of these two forces results in his feelings of inadequacy. He can’t follow his desires since society won’t allow him, denying him the pleasure of self-actualization. On the flip side, he can’t bring himself to live up to society’s expectations and is thus unable to get validation from it. Another prime example of this happening occurs when he sings “I'm trying to be the best I could be now / They say make it something we know”. Once again, his desires don’t align with society’s, making him feel inadequate.

                This song was released during an interesting time in Stevenson’s career. <i>Dreamland</i> (and the <i>Killjoy</i> album as a whole) was made when Stevenson wanted to depart from the approach he had to making music for the past few years. This approach focused on creating crowd-pleaser songs he knew would go over well with his audience. However, Stevenson wanted to pivot into an approach with a lot of similar elements, but with content more aligned with his authentic self. <i>Dreamland</i> seems to be a direct reflection of the fears Stevenson had of how his audience would react if he changed his style.

                This song seems to portray the fight to break free from cultural conditioning as a doomed fight; yet, by writing this song, he casts it as a topic worthy of discussion. However, he proved himself wrong, as when he did pivot his style, people kept listening to his music with positive feedback. As a matter of fact, <i>Dreamland</i> became the most popular song on the <i>Killjoy</i> album, with twenty-six million streams on Spotify as of September 2024, and one of Stevenson’s most popular songs overall. So, <i>Dreamland</i> proves that not only is the fight worth discussing, but should (and will) be celebrated, even if it’s a losing battle.
